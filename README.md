# landing-Page
The landing page consists of a header, hero section, features section, and a footer.
Inside the header, there's a navigation bar with links to different sections (Home, Services, About, Contact).
The hero section contains a main heading, a paragraph, and a "Get Started" button (styled as a call-to-action).
The features section contains three feature boxes with headings and short descriptions.
The footer includes a copyright notice.
A simple reset is applied using * to remove default margins and paddings and set the box-sizing to border-box for consistency.
The layout uses Flexbox in the .features section to align the feature boxes horizontally and adjusts to a vertical stack on smaller screens.
Responsive design is achieved using a media query that modifies the layout on screens smaller than 768px.
The .cta-btn is styled with padding, a background color, and hover effects to make it stand out.
